### Hi there 👋

Hi 👋, I'm Hasitha
An aspiring Software Engineer from Colombo, Sri Lanka. I am looking forward to improve my knowledge and my experience in MERN stack. I enjoy programming because it gives me a sense of building something useful. Although it may be frustrating at times I find the journey very fulfilling.
